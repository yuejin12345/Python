    "### Indenting and code blocks in Python\n",
    "Python's syntax is so simple that it relies upon **indentation** (and not curly braces like in other languages) beneath code blocks to mark their beginning and end. `if, for, while, def, with` are all statements that have indented code blocks underneath them. A block is ended when the indentation for the current line returns to where it was before the indentation began. [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/), a popular python style guide suggests 4 spaces (not tabs) for indentation. Jupyter notebooks default to 4 spaces as well and take care of it for you when you begin a code block that requires indentation."
