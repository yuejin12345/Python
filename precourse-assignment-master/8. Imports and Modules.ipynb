    "# Built-In Python Features\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever you first begin writing Python in a notebook, editor, or on the command line, you are using the **built-in** features of the language. These are the features that are always available to you. They consist of the following (numbers are approximate):\n",
    "\n",
    "* 70 [functions and types][1]\n",
    "* 30 [keywords][2]\n",
    "* 40 [Exceptions][3]\n",
    "* 50 [Operator and delimiter symbols][4]\n",
    "* Whitespace for indentation\n",
    "\n",
    "This list contains everything you can type from your keyboard that can be understood by the Python interpreter. This is what is meant by **built-in**. This core part of Python is what builds our programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus far, with just a few exceptions, we have used features that come from what is built-in directly to the language.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The Standard Library\n",
    "The [Python standard library][5], as it says in its name, is distributed with each Python installation. The standard library is not immediately available for you to use when you begin writing a Python program. You must use the **`import`** statement to access its functionality. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Third-Party Libraries\n",
    "Outside of the standard library are user-created libraries, sometimes referred to as **third-party** libraries. These can be found at the [Python Packaging Index][6] or pypi. There are over 100k libraries but only about 10-15 are common for data scientists. These libraries can be installed with **pip**, Python's command line packaging manager. But, we've already installed the Anaconda distribution which comes with most of the data science libraries pre-installed. It also has its own package manager **conda**.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Importing a module\n",
    "In Python, we use the **`import`** keyword to give us access to new functionality. We specify the module we want to import by typing its name directly after **`import`**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a module?\n",
    "All Python code is stored in files on your machine. Files that contain Python code are called **modules**. It is all the functions, types, and other objects within a module that we are getting access to when we run the import statement.\n",
    "\n",

    "We have already used the **`random`** module in previous notebooks. Let's import it again and examine it a bit closer.\n",
