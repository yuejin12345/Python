    "Functions are fundamental to all programming languages and have already been utilized quite a bit before this notebook. A function is a group of the same reusable programming statements that can be repeatedly called with a reference to the function name. Functions allow you to store code that you would like to reference over and over again without having to rewrite that same code for each execution. All functions must return a Python object (even if it is `None`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Built-in Functions\n",
    "Python comes standard with about [70 builtin functions][1] for the most common and important tasks. These are functions that are ready to use without any need to import them from other modules. The Python standard library contains many modules with access to hundred's of other functions that do require the **`import`** statement. And thanks to Python being open source, many tens of thousands of 3rd party libraries with functions for anything you can imagine have been built.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Calling Basic Functions\n",
    "Functions are referenced by their name. To execute the code they are referencing, you must append an open and close parentheses to them. Some functions have parameters that are used to modify the functionality within them. Values for these parameters must be placed within the parentheses separated by commas.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using built-in functions\n",
    "Below are some examples of using built-in functions. These will all be colored green (or some color) in most editors.\n",
