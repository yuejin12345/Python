    "# Use your objects with attributes and methods\n",
    "The power and usefulness of objects in Python come from their **attributes** and **methods**. All objects in Python have **attributes** and **methods**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Attributes are descriptions of the objects and are sometimes referred to as **properties**. Typically, they are nouns or adjectives. They are a single piece of information about the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Methods** are actions that the objects can take and are typically verbs. Methods execute a block of code while attributes typically retrieve one specific value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A practical example of an object\n",
    "Let's step outside of Python for a moment and think about objects as we do in the real world. A example to help understand attributes and methods would be a person. Examples of attributes about a person would be sex, age, hair color, height, address, and other basic facts about the person. Methods, on the other hand, would be actions a person could take such as eating, drinking, sleeping, jumping, playing, speaking, and any other human ability. \n",
    "\n",
    "I find analogizing physical objects to Python objects to be very helpful. Take a look at the following diagram. The top half shows a generic object. The bottom has three objects of different typse with methods and specific values for the attributes.\n",

    "# Use Dot Notation to access attributes and methods\n",

    "**Dot notation** is how you make use of your object and how you directly access the attributes and methods. Dot notation simply means placing a dot after your object followed by the attribute or method name.\n",

    "### No parentheses for an attribute\n",

    "Let's take a look at how attributes and methods are used in practice with a fictional **`mercedes`** object that is a member of a **`Car`** class. **`year`** is an attribute and **`drive_forward`** is a method with a single parameter **`miles`**.\n",

    "### Are there only methods for strings?\n",
    "In the last notebook on strings, we only called methods with our strings. Strings are an example of an object that only has methods and no attributes. When we start working with Pandas, you will see that the primary object, the DataFrame, has some attributes to go along with many methods.\n",

    "There are about 30 reserved words that are not objects. Some of these include **`if, return, def, except`**. A [full list][1] is available in the documentation. Take care that **`True`**, **`False`**, and **`None`** are in that list but are objects.\n",

    "Other symbols such as commas, parentheses, braces, and periods are not objects. Operators such as plus, minus, multiplication, and division signs, are also not objects. More formally, Python uses the terminology **`delimiters`** and **`operators`** for these two classes of symbols. A complete list is found in the [documentation][4] and printed below as well.\n",
