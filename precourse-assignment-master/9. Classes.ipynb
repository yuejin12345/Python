    "# Review: Everything is an object\n",
    "In notebook 3 on objects, we covered how \"everything\" is an object. The most basic piece of information of an object is its type. The type determines what kind of functionality the object has - namely by its attributes and methods. Thus far we have only created objects from built-in types such as integers, floats, booleans, strings, lists, sets, tuples, and dictionaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Objects vs Types\n",
    "Objects and types are closely related terms that are often confused. It might be good to use a non-programming example to distinguish between objects and types. Right now, I am using my MacBook computer. The MacBook is the object and its type is a computer. Perhaps a more direct way of saying this is \"my MacBook is a type of computer\". A few more similar examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "* You are an object that is of the person type\n",
    "* My neighbor's Honda Pilot is an object and is a type of car\n",
    "* Forrest Gump is an object and is a type of movie\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's turn our attention back to Python. We can make analogous statements such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`5`** is a type of integer\n",
    "* **`4.39`** is a type of float\n",
    "* **`[4, 8, 7]`** is a type of list\n",
    "* **`{'a': 1, 'z': 26}`** is a type of dictionary\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objects are tangible - Types are intangible\n",
    "My personal MacBook is one single physical (tangible) object. Its type, a computer, is just a generic name that gives us an idea about what functionality we can expect. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the objects are the things that are stored in memory in a specific location on your computer. For instance, **`[4, 8, 7]`** is the object and its type is list."

    "# Overview of Built-In Types\n",
    "The main built-in types, integers, floats, booleans, strings, lists, functions, ranges, sets, tuples, and dictionaries will provide the backbone for most of your Python code. These types have all been covered in the previous notebooks. There are several other built-in types that are not as common such as bytes, frozen sets, iterators, generators, and more that have not been covered but are still important and typically reserved as 'advanced' topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating New Types\n",
    "The standard library provides us with hundreds of other types that are easily accessible to import into our programs. While all these types cover the majority of needs, there will come a time in your Python career where you will need to create your own types. For instance, there is no built-in type that is available for cars.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Define a Type with `class`\n",
    "To define a new user-defined type, the **`class`** keyword is used followed by the name of the type and a colon. This is very similar to how new user-defined functions are created with the **`def`** keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's define the simplest class that we can. Notice that we do not put a set of parentheses after the class name. The body of the class is indented in the same manner as it is with functions. We can use the keyword **`pass`** to indicate that we don't want to add any functionality to our type. **`pass`** can be used in all indented code blocks, such as after function declarations, if/else blocks, and others to mean **do nothing**."
