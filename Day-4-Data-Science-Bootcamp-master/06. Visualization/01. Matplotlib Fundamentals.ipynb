    "# 01. Matplotlib Fundamentals\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives\n",
    "After this lesson you should be able to ...\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Be aware of the two independent plotting interfaces for matplotlib - the state-machine environment and the object-oriented interface\n",
    "1. Plot using the object-oriented interface of matplotlib with **`fig, ax = plt.subplots...`**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Resources\n",
    "1. [Matplotlib homepage](http://matplotlib.org)\n",
    "1. [General Usage Notes](http://matplotlib.org/faq/usage_faq.html) <--- Very highly recommended. Read until 'What is a backend?'\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "**`Matplotlib`** is a very popular and widely used plotting library in Python and is the default for creating  for most data scientists using Python. It was originally built to mimic the functionality of plotting with Matlab. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Two Interfaces\n",
    "There are two separate ways to interface with Matplotlib. One is called the **`state-machine environment`** and the other is with an **object-oriented** approach. The state-machine environment (known as **pyplot** from here on out) is a complex term for saying that matplotlib implicitly handles some of the plotting for you. \n",
    "\n",
    "The **object-oriented** approach gives you full control over each element of the plot and is the more Pythonic way of interacting with matplotlib. It is suggested you use the object-oriented approach. Nearly all plotting examples may be reproduced with either approach but the object-oriented approach is explicit and, in my opinion, easier to determine what is happening.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using only the object-oriented approach\n",
    "This notebook only uses the object-oriented approach, as attempting to learn both at the start is not necessary and confusing. Many examples online use pyplot so it is something that you will eventually need to understand. Much of the code between each approach will actually look quite similar when making a single plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Anatomy of a Figure\n",
    "![][1]\n",
    "There is a hierarchy you must understand when plotting with matplotlib. The highest and outermost part of a plot is the **Figure**. The figure contains all the other plotting elements, and you typically do not interact with it much. Inside the figure is the **Axes**. This is the actual plotting surface that you normally would refer to as a 'plot'. \n",
    "\n",
    "A figure may contain any number of these **Axes**. The **Axes** is a container for all of the other physical pixels that get drawn onto your screen. This includes the x and y axis, lines, text, points, legends, images, etc... \n",
    "\n",
    "### Axes is a confusing word\n",
    "The term **Axes** is not actually plural and does not mean more than one axis. It literally stands for a single 'plot'. It's unfortunate that this fundamental element has a name that is so confusing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Importing the pyplot module\n",
    "Importing matplotlib into your workspace is done a little differently than NumPy or Pandas. You rarely will import matplotlib itself directly like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> import matplotlib\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The above is perfectly valid code, but the matplotlib developers decided not to put all the main functionality in the top level module. \n",
    "\n",
    "### The difference between importing Pandas and Matplotlib\n",
    "When you **`import pandas as pd`**, you get access to nearly all of the available functions and classes of the library. This isn't true with Matplotlib. Instead, much of the functionality for quickly plotting is found in the pyplot module. If you navigate to the matplotlib source directory, found in your site-packages directory, you will see a **`pyplot.py`** file. This is the module that you are importing into your workspace.\n",
    "\n",
    "![][2]\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's import the pyplot module now and alias it to **`plt`**, which is done by convention:\n",
    "\n",

    "## Embedding plots into Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "To use matplotlib in Jupyter Notebook you need to run the magic command **`%matplotlib inline`** before making any plots. This embeds your plots directly into the output of the cells. If you do not, you will have to call the **`show`** method from your figure object, which will produce a plot in a separate window."

    "pyplot does provide lots of useful functions, one of which is to create a Figure and any number of Axes that you desire. You can do this without pyplot, but it is more difficult. It's also quite standard to begin the object-oriented approach by laying out your Figure and Axes first and then call methods from these objects.\n",
    "\n",

    "The pyplot **`subplots`** function creates a single Figure and any number of Axes. The first two arguments to it are integers that represent the number of rows and columns of Axes that you desire. For instance, the following call to **`subplots`** creates 6 Axes over a 2 by 3 grid."
